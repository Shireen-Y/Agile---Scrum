# Agile
- Values and principles that help people build software
- Agile manifesto:
  - uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping other do it. Through this work we have to value:
    - Individuals and interactions over processes and tolls
    - Working software over comprehensive documentation
    - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
    - Responding to change over following a plan
  - That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more
  - As new events unfold, the project team incorporates those realities into the ongoing work
  - Changes become opportunities to add value instead of being obstacles to avoid
  - Supported by 12 principles


# Scrum
- Team based framework to develop complex systems and products
- Implementation of agile in teams
- Three pillars:
  - Transparency
    - Everyone presents the facts as is and collectively collaborates for the common organisational objective. No one has a hidden agenda
  - Inspection
    - Not done by an inspector but by everyone on the Scrum team. The inspection can be done for the product, processes, people aspects, practices
  - Adaptation
    - Continuous improvement, to adapt based on the results of the inspection. Everyone should reflect on how to improve
- Scrum Team
  - Co-located
  - Engaged with customer(s)
  - Self-organising
  - Accountable and empowered
  - Cross functional
- Scrum Roles
  - Product owner
    - Key stakeholder who should have deep understanding of the product and communicates with both the team and other stakeholder
  - Scrum master - facilitator
    - Ensures the team keeps to the values of Scrum, facilities meetings and removes impediments/conflicts
  - Scrum team
    - Effectively 3-9 people
    - All doing whatever it takes to complete the agreed tasks
    - Everyone is not just committed, they are involved
- Scrum events
  - The sprint
    - Includes
      - Planning & development work
      - Daily scrum
      - Sprint review at the end
      - Team retrospective before the next sprint
    - During the sprint
      - No changes are made to endanger the sprint goal
      - Short planning horizon (no more than 1 month ahead)
      - Scope may be clarified and re-negotiated between the product owner and the development team
  - Daily scrum
    - Format
      - 15 min timeboxed event for the development team
      - Held every day of the sprint
      - Same time and place each day
      - Focuses on progress towards the sprint goal
      - Facilitated by the scrum master
    - Typical individual contribution

  - Sprint planning
    - Format
      - Collaborative work of the entire team
      - Timeboxed according to the duration of the sprint

- Scrum artefacts
  - Product backlog
    - Contains all of the stories to be done to complete the entire product
  - Sprint backlog
    - Contains only the stories to be worked on in the current sprint
  - Increment
    - A place of working software created in a sprint. The sum of all the increments forms the whole product
  - Definition of done
    - Shared agreement of what constitutes as ‘done’ for any story
- Information radiators
  - Task board
    - Used to track the work visually, showing the state of the sprint for both the team and other stakeholders
  - Burn up/down charts
    - Used to track team velocity, showing work completed vs time
  - Big visible charts
    - Any of a number of handwritten, drawn, printed or electronic displays which a team which a team places in a highly visible location, so that all team members as well as passers-by can see the latest information at a glance
