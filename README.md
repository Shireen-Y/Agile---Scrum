# Agile
- Values and principles that help people build software
- Agile manifesto:
  - uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping other do it. Through this work we have to value:
    - Individuals and interactions over processes and tolls
    - Working software over comprehensive documentation
    - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
    - Responding to change over following a plan
  - That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more
  - As new events unfold, the project team incorporates those realities into the ongoing work
  - Changes become opportunities to add value instead of being obstacles to avoid
  - Supported by 12 principles


# Scrum
- Team based framework to develop complex systems and products
- Implementation of agile in teams
- Three pillars:
  - Transparency
    - Everyone presents the facts as is and collectively collaborates for the common organisational objective. No one has a hidden agenda
  - Inspection
    - Not done by an inspector but by everyone on the Scrum team. The inspection can be done for the product, processes, people aspects, practices
  - Adaptation
    - Continuous improvement, to adapt based on the results of the inspection. Everyone should reflect on how to improve
- Scrum Team
  - Co-located
  - Engaged with customer(s)
  - Self-organising
  - Accountable and empowered
  - Cross functional
- Scrum Roles
  - Product owner
    - Key stakeholder who should have deep understanding of the product and communicates with both the team and other stakeholder
  - Scrum master - facilitator
    - Ensures the team keeps to the values of Scrum, facilities meetings and removes impediments/conflicts
  - Scrum team
    - Effectively 3-9 people
    - All doing whatever it takes to complete the agreed tasks
    - Everyone is not just committed, they are involved
