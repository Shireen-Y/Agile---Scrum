# User Profiles
- As a [type of user], I want [goal] so that [reason]
- User stories do not include all the detail - they are only a pointer to the real requirement
- Epics = huge user stories
- 2 primary ways to add more detail:
  - Splitting
  - Conditions of satisfaction / acceptance criteria
- Three amigos
  - Tester
  - Development
  - Product owner
  - Raises a lot of questions
  - Gain a shared understanding of what is needed and what is going to happen
  - All must agree that it is ready for development
  - This should happen before planning
  - Can happen again at story start
- Writing a good user story
  - Understandable (by normal people)
  - Follow “As a… I want… So that…”
  - Independent
  - Negotiable
  - Valuable
  - Estimable

    - Conversation
    - Confirmation
  - Acceptance criteria
    - Include product owner
    - Specific
    - Given and when statements – given that… when…
  - Estimation technique
    - One technique is planning poker using a special deck of cards with numbers on them
    - Decide on a scale representing the least to the most effort
    - Issue planning poker cards to each team member each card has a single number on it
    - The team discusses the effort of completing a task before revealing cards at the same time
    - If there is a big difference of values revealed, the team discusses the reasoning behind the smallest and largest values then has another round until consensus is reached
  - Backlog refinement
    - Removing user stories that aren’t relevant
    - Creating new user stories as a response to needs
    - Re-assessing priority
    - Assigning estimates
    - Correcting estimates
    - Split stories that are high priority but too large to fit in an upcoming iteration
  - Definition of done (D.O.D)
    - Be more general
    - Agreed by all the team and product owner
